 <h2>
     Fabulous air show of Paris in motion
     <br>
     My thought loo in flight and yearns for my Nation
     <br>
     When will the planes designed in my land
     <br>
     Pierce the sky as lightening in action
     <br>
     And gracefully land as angels in full bloom
     <br>
     All to the envy of spellbound spectators
     <br>
     Yes we can!!!
     <br>
     When we united in action and addicted to deeds
     <br>
     Sky can't be the limit for my nation in action!!
